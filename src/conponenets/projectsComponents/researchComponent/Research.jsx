                    My experience at Augustana college culminated in a special course
                    called the "Seniory Inquiry." Me and my team of a few other students worked
                    vigoursly over the course of 14 weeks to design, create and deploy a 
                    fitness based web app. This app handled user data with Firebase and was
                    powered by ReactJs.

                the courses they were taking during the school year. This app
                was coded in Java (utilizing the JavaFX library) and had some CSS styling as well.</div>
